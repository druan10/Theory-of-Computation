This is a test file only.  The program that uses this file is designed to count how many times a given word appears in this file, tell the user how many times that word appeard, and it must do so in a way that creates a NDFA transition table and then models a DFA using that table.  All test files, like all sentences, must end using punctuation and in this case, a period.
